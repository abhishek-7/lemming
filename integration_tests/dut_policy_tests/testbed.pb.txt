# PolicyTestCase contains the specifications for a DUT-only policy test.
#
# Topology:
#
#	DUT1 (AS 64500) -> DUT2 (AS 64500) -> DUT3 (AS 64501)
#	                    ^
#	                    |
#	DUT4 (AS 64502) -> DUT5 (AS 64500)
#
#       Additionally, DUT0 is present as a neighbour for DUT1, DUT4, and DUT5
#       to allow a static route to be resolvable.
#
# Currently by convention, all policies are installed on DUT1 (export), DUT5
# (export), and DUT2 (import). This is because GoBGP only withdraws routes on
# import policy change after a soft reset:
# https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/blob/master/docs/sources/policy.md#policy-and-soft-reset

# This DUT connects to DUT1, DUT4, and DUT5 for resolving static routes.
